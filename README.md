# Hangman 

-----------

This is the 2nd project I completed as part of JetBrains Academy's Python Developer track.

From the project's description (https://hyperskill.org/projects/69/stages/372/implement):
1. In the main menu, a player can choose to either play or exit the game.
2. If the user chooses to play, the computer picks a word from a list: this will be the answer to the puzzle.
3. The computer asks the player to enter a letter that they think is in the word.
4. If that letter does not appear in the word and this letter hasn't already been guessed, the computer counts it as a miss. A player can only afford 8 misses before the game is over.
5. If the letter does occur in the word, the computer notifies the player. If there are letters left to guess, the computer invites the player to go on.
6. When the entire word is uncovered, it's a victory! The game calculates the final score and returns to the main menu.

I've had lots of practice with the topics covered by this project, so I wouldn't say it taught me anything new. Every programmer seems to try their hand at coding a hangman game, so voila! Despite this project's ease, it was helpful to practice manipulating strings and mapping indicies and matching values from one ordered sequence to another. I also spent more than 30 minutes debugging what was only a simple typo, so there's that.

Topics covered include:
- functions
- loops
- lists, sets and tuples
- the 'random' module
